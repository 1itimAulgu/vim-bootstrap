The Ivory Steinway German D LITE Package is compatible with Windows and Mac OS X, and works as a Vst plugin or a standalone application. You can use it with any MIDI keyboard or controller, and customize it to your preferences with the intuitive user interface.

The Ivory Steinway German D LITE Package is a great option for anyone who wants a high-quality piano Vst without spending too much money or disk space. It delivers a rich and realistic sound that can suit any genre or style of music. You can get it for only $39 from Synthogy's website or from authorized dealers.
  
But how does the Ivory Steinway German D LITE Package compare to other piano VSTs on the market? There are many options available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular and diverse options are TruePianos, EZ Keys, Grand Rhapsody Piano, and Keyscape[^2^].
 
TruePianos is a modeling-based piano VST that offers four different piano modules: Diamond, Emerald, Sapphire, and Amber. Each module has its own character and sound, ranging from bright and modern to warm and vintage. TruePianos is designed to be easy to use and CPU-friendly, with minimal tweaking required. However, some users might find it too simplistic and lacking in realism compared to sampled pianos.
 
EZ Keys is a sampled piano VST that comes with a library of MIDI files that you can drag and drop into your DAW. You can also use the smart transpose feature to change the chords and keys of any MIDI file. EZ Keys is ideal for songwriters who want to quickly create piano parts without having to play them. However, some users might find it too limiting and generic for more advanced or expressive playing.
 
Grand Rhapsody Piano is a sampled piano VST that captures the sound of a Fazioli F228 grand piano at London's Metropolis Studios. It features eight microphone perspectives, from close to ambient, that you can mix and match to create your own sound. Grand Rhapsody Piano also has a built-in effects section, with EQ, compression, reverb, and delay. It is a very detailed and realistic piano VST that can suit any genre or style of music. However, some users might find it too heavy on the CPU and disk space.
 
Keyscape is considered the "holy grail" of piano plugins by many[^2^], and it took 10 years to make[^3^]. It features a collection of over 500 keyboard instruments, from acoustic pianos to electric pianos, organs, clavinets, harpsichords, and more. Each instrument is meticulously sampled and modeled, with authentic behavior and expression. Keyscape also integrates seamlessly with Omnisphere 2, allowing you to layer and morph sounds for endless possibilities. It is a very versatile and comprehensive piano VST that can cover any musical need. However, some users might find it too expensive and overwhelming for their purposes.
